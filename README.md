# udacity-landmark-project
This is Udacity's landmark project. It uses convolutional networks to predict the most likely locations where an image was taken. It can distinguish between 50 different landmarks.

landmark.ipynb is where the code and results can be found at. landmark.html is the html version of this Jupyter notebook.

The dataset used for training can be obtained from [this link](https://udacity-dlnfd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/datasets/landmark_images.zip).

You can find license information for the full dataset [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/google/google-landmarks-dataset).
